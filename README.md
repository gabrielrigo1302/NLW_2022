## NLW 2022 Project - Feedback Widget

### Types of WEB Application:

- SSR (Server Side Rendering): Frontend and backend are in the same code. Browser do requests to the application and it returns a page (HTML + CSS + JS, for example). This method doesn't works very well when we need to develop a multi-platform application because needs to duplicate de server and adjust responses for each platform;

- SPA (Single Page Application): Very similar to the SSR, but backend and frontend are not integrated, allowing to have only one backend that will communicate with each frontend (as many as needed). Each frontend will be developed to treat an specific platform (IOS/Android/WEB);

### Observations:

- TS: JS + typing
- JSX: JS + XML
- TSX: TS + JSX

- For some reason, npm commands only works when I open terminal as admin.
